# Exercise: Write a unit test for controllers/rooms/room that checks the timestamp a new message

Write a new test case in tests/unit/controllers/rooms/room-test.js to check the timestamp of a newly created message.

Hint 1: Have a look at the existing tests in tests/unit/controllers/rooms/room-test.js

Hint 2: You probably don't want to check the exact value of the timestamp, but some other properties might be worth testing.
